    Do smartphones have a place in the classroom?
    
    In my opinion, smartphones dont have a place in the classroom, because they distract us. 
    Nowadays, we use social media pretty much all the time, and these heavily impact us. 
    For example, if we were doing school-related work, and out of nowhere our social media app's would keep popping 
    up with notifications. This would distract us, and then we wouldn't be focused on our work.
